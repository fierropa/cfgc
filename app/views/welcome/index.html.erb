        For many children in Southeast Los Angeles County, however, childhood has been compromised by abuse and neglect, poverty, and family conflicts. 
        In 2009, 157,960 children were referred to the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services for allegations of abuse or neglect, and 19,635 children were living in foster care, relative care, or adoptive homes.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Often overwhelmed with poverty, substance abuse, and their own mental health needs, 
        the parents of these children are unable to provide the safety and security these children need.

        Children impacted by abuse and neglect are at a higher risk of developing mental health disorders, 
        such as depression, anxiety disorders, and behavioral difficulties 
      </p>
      <p>
        With comprehensive, individualized treatment, however, many of these children and their families can lead healthy and happy lives.
